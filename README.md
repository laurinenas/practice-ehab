# Task:

Using a React based framework (Create React App), create a simplified version of the app below.


It should plot the price of a cryptocurrency coin of your choice in USD over time, with options to change the time frame.


You can use any public cryptocurrency api (i.e. https://www.coingecko.com/en/api ) you like or are familiar with.





( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedera/ )  



### Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] The chart compares a single cryptocurrency coin with USD

- [x] The results are plotted on a line chart

- [x] The line chart shows the price in USD over 1 day as default

- [ ] There are 3 buttons to change the time frame - 1 day, 7 days, 1 month

- [ ] When a button is clicked, the graph will update



### Constraints:

- [ ] Spend 2 hours on this - if you don’t finish, don’t worry, we just want to see some code / your thinking.

- [x] Use a charting library of your choice (i.e. Recharts)

- [x] Prefer functional components + hooks over class based components

- [ ] Use any third party libraries you might need

- [x] Use any CSS-in-JS implementation you want (i.e. Styled Components)

- [x] Do not use a component library (except for the chart).

- [ ] Write some tests (i.e. Jest + React Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright

- [x] Write a readme that explains your decisions / potential next steps

- [x] Bonus : use TypeScript

- [ ] Bonus : host it somewhere (e.g. Vercel)

## Directory structure

### data

Has all the mocked data we may need to use as dependency

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
